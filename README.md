üìä Bank Loan Report Dashboard üìà
Welcome to the Bank Loan Report Dashboard! This project offers comprehensive insights into our bank's lending activities, facilitating data-driven decisions and strategic planning. The dashboard is organized into three main sections: Summary, Overview, and Details.

üìù Problem Statement
To effectively monitor and evaluate our bank's lending activities, we've developed a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report provides insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time, enabling us to make data-driven decisions, track the health of our loan portfolio, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

üìä Dashboard 1: Summary
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Total Loan Applications: Calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Monitor Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

Total Funded Amount: Understand the total amount of funds disbursed as loans. Keep an eye on MTD Total Funded Amount and analyze MoM changes.

Total Amount Received: Track the total amount received from borrowers to assess cash flow and loan repayment. Analyze MTD Total Amount Received and observe MoM changes.

Average Interest Rate: Calculate the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitor MoM variations to gain insights into the overall cost of our lending portfolio.

Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluate the average DTI for borrowers to gauge their financial health. Compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track MoM fluctuations.

üí° Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs
To evaluate the performance of our lending activities and assess the quality of our loan portfolio, we distinguish between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' based on specific loan status criteria.

Good Loan KPIs:

Good Loan Application Percentage: Calculate the percentage of loan applications classified as 'Good Loans,' including loans with a status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'

Good Loan Applications: Identify the total number of loan applications falling under the 'Good Loan' category.

Good Loan Funded Amount: Determine the total amount of funds disbursed as 'Good Loans,' including principal amounts of loans with a status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'

Good Loan Total Received Amount: Track the total amount received from borrowers for 'Good Loans,' encompassing all payments made on loans with a status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'

Bad Loan KPIs:

Bad Loan Application Percentage: Calculate the percentage of loan applications categorized as 'Bad Loans,' specifically including loans with a status of 'Charged Off.'

Bad Loan Applications: Identify the total number of loan applications categorized as 'Bad Loans.'

Bad Loan Funded Amount: Determine the total amount of funds disbursed as 'Bad Loans,' comprising principal amounts of loans with a status of 'Charged Off.'

Bad Loan Total Received Amount: Track the total amount received from borrowers for 'Bad Loans,' including all payments made on loans with a status of 'Charged Off.'
